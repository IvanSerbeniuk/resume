            <h1>Telegram bot</h1>

            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://t.me/social_rank_bot">Try this bot</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/IvanSerbeniuk/social-rank-bot">Source code</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p >The bot is hosted on the web host <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">Pythonanywhere</a> and runs continuously in the background, ensuring that it is always available to use.<br> The code is well-documented, making it easy to understand and modify as needed. </p>

            <p>I have developed a Python script that leverages the Telegram API to manage a points-based system for group chats. <br> The script uses the 'telegram' and 'decouple' libraries, and includes functionality to add and subtract points from users via the '/addpoints' and '/subtractpoints' commands.</p>

            <p>The script also performs user and chat validation to ensure that only administrators can modify the points, and that the points values provided are valid integers.<br> Additionally, it includes error handling and logging functionality to provide useful feedback to users and administrators in case of errors.</p>

            <p>This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python and API integration, as well as my ability to design and develop scripts that are robust, scalable, and user-friendly.</p>
